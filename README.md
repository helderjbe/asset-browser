# Asset Browser

## Priority

- UI / UX Manipulation considering the role. Implications: Focus on UI, not API integration.

## Assumptions

- Using only Tailwind and Next.js (client components only) for simplicity and focusing on priority.
- Show all button in each category (assumed from the diagram "Show more of asset").
